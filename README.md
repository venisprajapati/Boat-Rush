# Boat-Rush

## Project Overview
This is 2D game made with python library named Pygame. To learn more functionality of programming language like python. In this game there is one boat which has to reach another place with goods. This boat has to face obstacles like burg, shark, another boats, and many other fishes. This is infinite rush game. You also given Realtime score.

## Problem and Solution Statement
Player of the game has to transport the goods from one place to another place. In this game there is many obstacles that you have to clear to reach to your location. As being an infinite run game, you only have to just clear the obstacles and score more in your score board. The Technology used in this game is Python, library named pygame. The Game is made with GUI. You can play it by running python script.

## Benchmark (How this solution is better? compare)
This game provides you features of scoreboard. This is score refers to the distance you covered in journey. By this game you can have ideas of boat simulations in real life with different types of hurdles. This game provides us the basic use of the python library named Pygame. By using this library you can have chance to learn more about programming with python.

## Implementation strategy
This game is made with pygame and provides the more functionality in future like changing boats, new colors, new themes, new levels, new appearance, sounds, and more obstacles. We also can develop artificial intelligence for Obstacles and functionality in boats there is new levels, and new UI for better experience.
